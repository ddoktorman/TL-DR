# TL-DR
INTRODUCTION
------------
TL;DR is a web application built for Stuyvesant High School students to catch up on their reading. Users can select their grade, class, and book, and the application returns a page with a general summary of the book, a chapter by chapter summary, character analysis, and themes. It utilizes a python script to scrape data from websites such as Shmoop and Sparknotes, and returns this information in an easy to read way.
